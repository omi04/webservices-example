# webservices-example
This is sample web-services example created just for the sake of understanding the basic concept. It covers both SOAP and REST web-services example.

1. Import the project in any IDE. 
2. Use JDK 11 or higher
3. Compile the project 
4. Run the application using main class
5. There is no configuration added in the properties since it is just for testing purpose
6. There is an offline repository which is used to mimic database call
7. Both REST and SOAP examples are added to compare the differences, benefits and dis-advantages in a particular use case.
8. I have taken an example of Restaurant application where using both SOAP and REST endpoints, we can fetch the data from offlineRepository
